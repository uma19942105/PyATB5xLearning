#write a program to take a user age and
#let him know if he can go to the club
#21
#logic build formula
#step1
# user input i/p -> datatype-> int
#o/p->string ->user if he can  go or not
#Step 2. Rough logic(brute force
# age >21->print can go
# age <21-> print can't go
# step 3. write the logic


#  step 4 check  for the edge cases
#We should  consider edge cases such as
# Negative ages or extremely high values-> program will brea.
#Non -numeric inputs-ABc
#Age which  is valid .>130
#

#step 5 optimize the code
# Handle all the edges.
